# Portaria Remota Summer Academy

Project made for Accenture's Summer Academy. 

This project was made with React and Javascript.

The idea behind the project was coding a remote entrance hall, allowing the user to add visits with some informations, like: 

- Name;
- Date of the visit;
- Hour of the visit;
- Document type;
- Document number;
- Optional remark.

The project has two pages: 

- Home: Where the visits are stored with visit name, date, hour, status, edit button and cancel button;
- Visit Data: Where the user can register or edit the visit informations or cancel the visit.
